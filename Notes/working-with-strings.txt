To declare a string variable we use

    string stringVariable = "I am string"

    - With string being the data type
    - stringVariable being the variable to hold the string
    - and DOUBLE quotes around the text you'd like to use


String methods in c# are just the same as using methods in JS,

    string greeting = "Hello, I'm communicating through the console.";

    Console.WriteLine(greeting.toLower());  // output: "hello, i'm communicating through the console.

    Console.WriteLine(greeting.toUpper());  // output: "HELLO, I'M COMMUNICATING THROUGH THE CONSOLE.

    Console.WriteLine(greeting.Substring(7)); // output: "I'm communicating through the console."

All apps built using dotnet new Console begin with a using directive that refrences the system namespace

Namespaces provide a hieratchial means of organizing C# programs and libraries, for example
the System namespace contains a number of types, such as the Console class, IO, and Collections

By convention, a static method named Main serves as the entry point to C# programs
    - A method contains both an input and output
        ~ The input is whatever is in the () of Main
        ~ The output is what goes before the Main , ie static, which tells C# the data it would
          like to get back

Types and variables:
    - An identifier is a variable name
    - There are two kinds of types in C#
        1. Value Types
            ~ Conttains it's data directly
            ~ Each variable of a value type has a copy of it's data 
        2. Refrence Types (objects)
            ~ Stores a refrence to it's data
            ~ It is possbile for two variables of a refrence type to refrence the same object,
              meaning two variables may the same object

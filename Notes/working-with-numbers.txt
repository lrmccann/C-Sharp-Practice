To declare a number we can use a variety of different data type declerations, but one of the most common ones is 
        int age = 23;

        - With int being the data type
        - age being the identifier
        - 23 being the value of age

Number methods are the same as number methods in JS,

    Console.WriteLine($"The sum of 9 and 10 is {9 + 10}");  // output: "The sum of 9 and 10 is 19"
    
    Console.WriteLine($"(3 + 2) * 10 is equal to {(3 + 2) * 10}");  // output: "(3 + 2) * 10 is equal to 60"
